# Run specific steps in your desired order

workflow:
  steps:
    - extract-source
    - migrate
    # Note: Skipping map-members, so assignMaintainerIds should be false

  projectKey: legacy-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com  # Optional: Defaults to app.launchdarkly.com

destination:
  projectKey: modern-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com  # Optional: Use app.eu.launchdarkly.com for EU instance

migration:
  # No maintainer mapping since we're skipping map-members step
  assignMaintainerIds: false
  
  migrateSegments: true
  conflictPrefix: "legacy-"
  targetView: "legacy-migration"
